SERVEUR HTTP FAIT MASION

Dependencies:

	- C compiler (cc)
	- GNU bash (or maybe another modern sh-type unix shell)
	- Python 2.x

Notes:
	- this probably won't work on windows. use
	  one of the many unices available (linux, mac os x, ...)

	- to start the ncweb httpd, type
		./run

Warning:

	- i know very little about security.
	  there is just a buffer overflow preventer in
	  ncweb.c. use a good firewall !
